# API
- Using APIs as a technical solution - to create two financial analysis tools.

## The first analysis will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they     have enough money as an emergency fund.
  * Assuming that the average household income for each member of the credit union is $12,000. 
  * monthly_income variable created and set its value to 12000.
  * Assuning crypto assets: 1.2 for BTC and 5.3 for ETH.
  * Two variables created called my_btc and my_eth. Set them equal to 1.2 and 5.3, respectively.
  * The requests library was use to fetch the current price in US dollars of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH).

## The second will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run     Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.

  * Using the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio and then Use the MCForecastTools toolkit to create Monte Carlo simulations to project the       portfolio performance at 30 years. following the analysis, Monte Carlo data will be use to answer questions about the portfolio.
  * Using five years historical closing prices for a traditional 40/60 portfolio using the SPY and AGG tickers to represent the 60% stocks (SPY) and 40% bonds (AGG) composition of     the portfolio
